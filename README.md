Floating Solar PV System Design & Feasibility Analysis For a Location in Bihar, India.

The site chosen for the analysis is near the Indrapuri barrage, Rohtas, Bihar, India.

lattitude of the proposed location- 24.83°
longitude of the proposed location- 84.13°
Avg. altitude of the proposed location- 105m

The proposed location is analysed for its plant capacity and future scalability, different design layouts, and the electrical & economical feasibility for the plant.

The design for the plant layout and the shadow analysis is done using the 3D modelling software "Sketchup".
The performance analysis for its electric and economical feasibility is done using Pvsyst 8.0.15.

The meteorological data for the analysis is taken from the Meteonorm 8.2 in the PVsyst.

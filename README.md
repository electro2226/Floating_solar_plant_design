## Project-overview
With the rising demand for clean energy and increasing pressure on land resources, Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FSPV) systems have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional land-based solar installations. India, with its vast network of reservoirs, lakes, and water bodies, has witnessed a surge in FSPV adoption, driven by government initiatives and the need to optimize space utilization in densely populated regions.

This project explores the design and analysis of a 20/22.5 MWp floating solar plant proposed for deployment on Indrapuri barrage in Rohtas, Bihar, India. Unlike traditional ground-mounted systems, FSPV installations offer distinct advantages: they eliminate land acquisition challenges, reduce evaporation losses from water surfaces, and benefit from enhanced energy yield due to reduced ambient temperatures and minimal shading.

The study outlines multiple FSPV variants based on their design layouts and orientations tailored to the proposed site conditions. It evaluates the electrical performance,  and environmental impact of the floating system. The design methodology incorporates site-specific constraints, platform stability, and optimal tilt angles to ensure reliable and efficient energy generation.

## Proposed-site

The site chosen for the analysis is near the Indrapuri barrage, Rohtas, Bihar, India. It is located over the Sone river. The geographical location of the project is:  
lattitude of the proposed location- 24.83Â°  
longitude of the proposed location- 84.13Â°  
Avg. altitude of the proposed location- 105m  




The proposed location is analysed for its plant capacity and future scalability, different design layouts, and the electrical & performance feasibility for the plant.

The design for the plant layout and the shadow analysis is done using the 3D modelling software "Sketchup".
The performance analysis for its electric and economical feasibility is done using Pvsyst 8.0.15.

The meteorological data for the analysis is taken from the Meteonorm 8.2 in the PVsyst.

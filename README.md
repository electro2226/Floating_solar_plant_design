# Floating_solar_plant_design

Floating Solar PV System Design & Feasibility Analysis (20.24 MW) 
• Simulated and optimized a floating solar plant using PVsyst, achieving 1156 kWh/kWp/year yield and 75.42% PR 
• Conducted detailed cable sizing, loss analysis, and economic modeling, resulting in ₹1.99/kWh LCOE and 9.9-year payback 
• Used realistic benchmark-based dummy data due to limited access to site measurements
• Delivered a bankable report integrating technical rigor with financial viability for utility-scale deployment
